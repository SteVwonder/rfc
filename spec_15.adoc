== Introduction

In the traditional resource management model, a monolithic resource
manager runs with the credentials of a privileged user, typically using
long-running daemons with elevated privileges on compute resources. These
daemons allow the resource manager to complete necessary privileged
work, such as modification of containers, system preparation (such as
prolog/epilog scripts), and most importantly allow the transition of
credentials to that of the requesting user, so that jobs may be successfully
executed in a multi-user environment.

Drawbacks to this monolithic approach include:

 * Total amount of code running with privilege is increased above what
   is strictly necessary
 * Testing of privileged code is more difficult
 * Security patches and updates require a new release of entire project

In the Flux model, however, an instance runs at most with the credentials
of the _instance owner_ (a normal, unprivileged user), including all
processes running on computational resources of the instance. This design
works well for single-user instances of Flux, but multi-user capable
instances require some mechanism to perform privileged operations, most
notably when executing work on behalf of a non instance owner (a guest).

In the Flux system, this privilege - along with all related operations - is
contained within a single service, the _Independent Minister of Privilege_
(IMP), which is responsible for allowing instance owners to run work on
behalf of a guest when the guest user has authorized the instance to do so.

By placing all code running with elevated privilege into a single service,
the following benefits are realized:

 * Code running under privilege is reduced to the logical minimum
 * The privileged service can be tested separately from other Flux components
 * The privileged software release cycle is decoupled from core
   Flux code, allowing updates to be applied out of band.
 * The privileged service is completely under sysadmin control, while
   still allowing users to run test or private versions of Flux even
   in multi-user mode.
 * More fine grained administrative control of privilege. For example,
   simple filesystem access controls may be used to limit which
   users are allowed to run multi-user without preventing these users
   from launching Flux instances altogether.
 * Arbitrary users can run multi-user instances of Flux, thus allowing
   users to share their jobs 

=== User Roles

For the purposes of this RFC there are four main user roles:

owner, instance owner, or resource owner::
  The user under which a Flux instance is running, not privileged.
  This user is considered the owner of all resources to which the Flux
  instance is running.

system owner::
  The user under which the system instance of Flux is running.
  The default owner of all resources on the system.

guest user, or guest::
  A user wishing to use services or run work in a Flux instance when
  they are not the instance owner.

superuser, or root::
  A user with access to perform required privileged operations during
  multi-user execution, such as gaining credentials of other users,
  system setup or initialization, container manipulation, etc. Typically
  the root user.

=== Implementation Requirements

The Flux Security IMP SHALL be implemented with the following overall
design

 * The IMP SHALL be an independent Flux Framework project, with the ability
   to be tested standalone
 * The IMP SHALL be implemented as an executable, `flux-security-imp`,
   which MAY be installed with setuid permissions in cases where multi-user
   Flux is required.
 * The IMP SHALL accept and process data using stdin, to avoid putting
   sensitive data on the command line or environment.

Implementation of the IMP as a separately installed, setuid executable
allows sysadmin control over where and how the IMP is enabled. If the
`flux-security-imp` executable is not installed, or installed without
setuid bits enabled, then multi-user Flux is simply not available, though
single user instances of Flux will still operate. The file permissions,
access controls, or SELinux policy of `flux-security-imp` may also be
manipulated to restrict access to a user or group of users. For instance,
a site may configure permissions such that only a `flux` user has execute
permissions, thus allowing a multi-user system instance running as `flux`,
but disallowing sub-instance jobs access to multi-user capabilities.

=== Overall Design

When a guest makes a request for a job to a multi-user instance of
Flux, the guest will create a message with information such as the job
specification, a time-to-live, a uid, and an authorized resource owner,
and then uses IMP client API to sign all fields of the message. The signed
message becomes the user request token *_J_* which authorizes the resource
owner to execute the request at some point on behalf of the guest.

This signed request then becomes part of the user's job.  When the job is
scheduled by the instance, the owner assigns a resource set *_r_* to the job,
and writes that information to the job record, marking the job as
runnable.

The execution system within the instance then determines the set of
resources on which an invocation of the IMP is required and creates
a local resource set, which is necessarily disjoint for each IMP, and
acts as a representation of the local resources to which the IMP should
grant access to the guest user.

The local resource set and *_J_*, along with other optional fields,
are then concatenated and become input to the Flux IMP executable.
The IMP verifies through local configuration and state that the
instance owner has authority to grant access to resources in the
local resource set, and verifies via *_J_* that the guest has
authorized the resources owner to execute specific work on their
behalf.

The IMP verifies the integrity and authenticity of *_J_*
using cryptographic methods provided by plugins.  Once the verification
step is complete, the privileged IMP will invoke system configured
plugins for setup and containment, then change credentials to the
guest user, and finally execute the processes of the job as specified
in *_J_*.

In most cases, the IMP will execute a _job shell_ on behalf of the user,
passing the verified *_J_* as input to the shell. The shell itself is
specified either by the user in *_J_* or by IMP configuration, but
should not be provided or modified by the instance owner. The shell re-verifies
integrity and authenticity of *_J_* before proceeding, then interprets
the jobspec contained in *_J_* to determine the set of tasks to invoke
on the current resource set.

[NOTE]
It may be noted that the user's request *_J_* is verified twice when a job
shell is invoked, and this is by design. The IMP verifies *_J_* to avoid
passing tainted input to the job shell, which runs as the guest user.
The shell re-verifies *_J_* because it has no guarantee that the caller
has already done this verification, or that *_J_* has not been changed
since any past verification.

Flux instance.

== Input to the IMP

The input to the IMP includes the following fields

 * Local assigned resource set
 * Options supplied by resource owner
 * User Request (*_J_*) (described below)

Where *_J_* is the User Request or reference to such a request,
which SHALL contain

 * Jobspec as per link:spec_14{outfilesuffix}[14/Canonical Job Specification]
 * Options supplied by guest user
 * Guest user uid or username
 * Job shell path
 * UUID
 * Timestamp and TTL
 * Intended recipient (instance owner)
 * Allowed resource set
 * User signature (of above fields)

Where above fields have the following specific meanings and requirements

 * _Local assigned resource set_ is the list of *local* resources assigned
   to this job by the resource owner. It will be used by IMP plugins to
   implement containment.
 * _Timestamp and TTL_ signifies that the request in question SHALL
   only be valid between _Timestamp_ and _Timestamp+TTL_. This puts a
   time horizon on usage of *_J_*
 * _UUID_ is a globally unique identifier
 * _Intended recipient_ is set to the instance owner that is the target
   of the request. This ensures that the user's request cannot be
   used by another arbitrary user.
 * The _user signature_ signs all fields of *_J_*
 * The _job shell path_ is an absolute path to a job shell which
   will act as interpreter of the Jobspec in *_J_*. If missing, a default
   will be supplied by IMP configuration.


== IMP Internal Operation

=== Privilege Separation

When the IMP is invoked _and_ has setuid privileges, the process MAY
use privilege separation to limit the impact of programming errors or
bugs in libraries. For more information on privilege separation, see
the paper on privilege separated OpenSSH: "Preventing Privilege
Escalation".
footnote:[http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/papers/privsep.pdf[Preventing Privilege Escalation], Niels Provos, Markus Friedl, Peter Honeyman.]

=== Request Verification

Once the privileged IMP process has read its input
it SHALL perform the following verification steps:

 1. Verify integrity and authenticity of *_J_*
 2. Verify recipient field in *_J_* matches current real UID of the IMP
    (i.e. the resource owner)
 3. Verify TTL on *_J_*

The IMP process MAY also perform the following OPTIONAL verification steps:

 * Verify that the current real UID of the IMP process is the "owner"
   of the current container.
 * Verify that the intersection of the assigned resource set and the
   current container is not empty.

Container ownership verification is considered optional because all
non-system-owner processes in Flux MUST be started by the IMP and
thus will be placed in inescapable containers. It thus follows that
a user running the IMP has ownership of the resources on which the
IMP has been invoked. This strategy is described further in the
"Resource ownership verification" section below.

Determining the intersection of the assigned resource with the current
resource set is considered optional because this check will be a side
effect of sub-container creation. If, after all container creation
plugins have been run, the container for the job is empty, the IMP
will abort with an error. Therefore an initial verification check
may be redundant.

==== Resource ownership verification

Resources in Flux are initially owned by the _system owner_, i.e. the
user which runs the system instance. Typically, this would be some
special system user, e.g. `flux`. The system owner is the only trusted
user and resource ownership of requests from this user SHALL NOT require
verification.

In order to verify resource ownership for non-system users, the
following requirements should be met:

 * The IMP SHALL support some sort of containment strategy, implemented
   via plugins for maximum flexibility.
 * The IMP's container mechanism MUST support, at a minimum, process
   tracking functionality capable of creating inescapable process groups.
 * The IMP's container strategy MUST be hierarchical, such that containers
   for jobs within an instance are created as sub-containers of
   container of the parent.

With the following requirements met, the IMP may verify resource
ownership by ensuring that the current container includes the
resources in the assigned resource set, and that the invoking user
is owner of the current container.

==== Revoking resource ownership

Resource ownership MUST be revokable. The result of a revocation SHALL
include termination of all processes currently running in the container
associated with the revoked resource grant. A revocation is recursive,
and removes the container and all child containers, including ancillary
data.

=== IMP post-verification execution

After verification of input is complete, the `flux-security-imp`
invokes required job setup code as the superuser. This setup code SHALL
be implemented as system-installed and verified plugins, and MAY include
such things as

 * Execution of some sort of job prolog
 * modification of system settings
 * creation of directories
 * state cleanup
 * optional behavior

Once privileged setup is complete, the security IMP SHALL generate a log
message or other audit trail for the individual request.  The IMP then
SHALL proceed to obtain credentials of the guest user and finally exec(2)
the *job shell path* specified in *_J_*, or a IMP configuration default.
After the call to exec(2) the security IMP is replaced by the guest user
process, and is no longer active.

=== Other IMP operational requirements

A multi-user instance of Flux not only requires the ability to execute
work as a guest user, but it must also have privilege to monitor and
kill these processes as part of normal resource manager operation.

==== Signaling and terminating jobs in a multi-user instance

For terminating and signaling processes the IMP SHALL include a `kill`
subcommand which, using the process tracking functionality, SHALL allow
an instance owner to signal or terminate any guest processes including
ancestors thereof that were started by the owner's instance.

=== IMP configuration

On execution, the `flux-security-imp` SHALL read a site configuration
file which MAY contain site-specific information such as paths to trusted
executables, plugin locations, certificate authority information etc.
The IMP SHALL check for correct permissions on all configuration
files to reduce the risk of tampering.

=== Specific Defenses

This section describes some attacks and their specific defenses. It
is still a work in progress.

 * _Executing arbitrary process as another user_: The entirety of a user
   job request, including executables, arguments, working directory,
   environment variables, etc, has an integrity guarantee, therefore
   a request cannot be forged, even by the instance owner.

 * _Replay attacks_, where a user's job request is run again without their
   express permission, or a request is taken to another system and executed
   without authority. The _intended recipient_ field of the user request
   protects against users other than the instance owner using the
   guest request, and a fixed time-to-live prevents the request from
   being used indefinitely. Finally, the `flux-security-imp` logs all
   invocations, thereby allowing replays to be detected and audited.
